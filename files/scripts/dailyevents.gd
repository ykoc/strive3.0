Now free, $name scurries towards you as $his savior. With a nod, you tell $him to let you handle this, and gesture $him from the room. Then, you turn to face $2name.\n\n[color=yellow]– I can explain, Master. This is all just a misunderst--[/color]\n\nYou cut off $2name’s protestations with a curt shake of your head, and ask $2him in a cold voice if $2he believes $2he has the right to assault $2his fellow servants, your servants. You slap $2him when $2he tries to respond, and again as $he tries to explain, until finally $he is silent.\n\nAfter that, it’s a simple matter to drag $2name to your dungeon, $2his cries for forgiveness and mercy likely keeping some of your servants awake late into the night.","You watch the assault unfold, $2name’s hand pushing beneath $name’s clothing to the juncture of $his thighs. $name struggles to resist the sensations $2name is forcing on $him, but eventually $his face begins to flush, $his chest rising and falling in breathy moans until $he falls trembling to the ground at $2name’s feet. It’s at that moment that you choose to enter the room.\n\n$2name turns in surprise as you enter the room, but something about your expression informs $2him that you don’t entirely disapprove of $2his actions. Grinning deviously, $2he pushes $name to the floor, holding $him down while $2he looks up at you.\n\n[color=yellow]– $He’s all prepared, Master. Would you like me to hold $him down for you while you have some fun?[/color]\n\n$name tries to struggle, to catch your eye and plead for mercy. But you pay $him little heed as you begin to remove your clothing.","It take a bare minimum of magical effort to send $2name into a brief-but-deep sleep, $2his body collapsing to the floor. A moment’s more spellwork, and $2name’s unconscious form is shackled magically to the wall next to $name, who has begun to squirm as $he realizes you haven’t arrived as $his saviour.\n\n$2name comes-to a few moments later, eyes dazed and muscles tensing as $2he struggles against the magical bonds holding $2him immobile. You slap $2him a few times to still $2him, slapping $name a few times as well for good measure. You explain that their little show has left you quite aroused, and now you intend to do something to solve that little problem.\n\nTheir eyes widen as you begin to strip the clothing from their helpless bodies.","You chuckle to yourself, stepping away from the doorway as $name continues to whimper and protest against $2name’s assault. You decide that it’s not your job to police every interaction between your servants and, clasping your hands behind you back, you stroll away from the room and leave $name to $his feet."],
sabotagevent = ["Your headgirl approaches you in the evening with some concerns about two of your servants. It seems that $name has been making a number of small mistakes lately, such as breaking some small items or leaving tasks undone. Since each of the mistakes was relatively minor your headgirl handled them personally, but the sheer number of incidents made her feel that you should be informed.\n\nWhen you look into the incidents, you begin to notice an odd coincidence. Every time $name broke an item, your other servant $2name was also nearby. Every time $name left a task undone, $2name was the one who reported $him. Although you have no hard evidence, you begin to suspect that $2name is sabotaging $name, perhaps due to some personal argument or dislike.","[color=yellow]– It’s not fair, Master, please, it’s not fair! I didn’t break those things, I don’t know how they--[/color]\n\n$name’s protestations of innocence are cut off as you force the ballgag into $his mouth, the crowd of servants watching in silence behind you. You bind $name’s arms behind $him and easily lift $him onto the sawhorse, listening to $him squeal as $his full weight falls down onto the sensitive area between $his thighs. A few well-placed spanks only add to the squeals, until $name is flushed in the face with tears in $his eyes.\n\nTurning to the crowd of watching servants, you tell them that $name is going to spend the night thinking about $his mistakes, and they would do well to think about them as well. Then you lead the crowd of servants out of the dungeon, leaving $name alone to suffer on the sawhorse. As you walk by $2name, you can’t help but notice a look of vindictive glee on $2his face.","Looking at the crowd of your servants, you tell them that sabotage, deception and false accusations will not be tolerated. $2name is silent behind you, standing bound and spread with a rope around each wrist and ankle, $2his mouth held open by a ring gag. $2He quickly becomes less silent as the whip begins to fly through the air.\n\nAgain and again the whip falls as $2name twists between the ropes you’ve bound $2him in, leaving light red marks on $2his chest, thighs and arse. Behind you, the crowd of servants inhales each time the whip whistles through the air, echoing $2name’s gasps and cries through the ring gag.\n\nFinally, you decided that $2name has had enough an put the whip down, leaving $2him crying in his bondage. You gesture for all of the watching servants to leave, wanting to have a private word with $2name before you release $2him. Catching a glimpse of $name as $he turns to leave, you see a gleam of justified satisfaction in $his eyes.","Calling both $name and $2name into your study, you tell them what you have learned, and you tell them that you expect them to end whatever feud exists between them, here and now. Shamefaced, they agree, and you order them to show you how friendly they can be with each other.\n\nLeaning back in your chair, you watch as the two servants kiss, their hands fumbling uncertainty up and down each other’s body. Then, once you’re properly excited from their ‘show,’ you order them to work together, to make up to you for your trouble and broken possessions.","You decide that it’s not your duty to dig into the enmities between your servants, or to investigate and second guess every punishable offense  they commit. That in mind, you tell your headgirl to continue punishing $name if $he seems responsible for a mistake, the same as she would any of your other servants."],
